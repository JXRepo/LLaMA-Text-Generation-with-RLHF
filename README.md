# LLaMA-Text-Generation-with-RLHF
# LLaMA-RLHF
Fine-tune a **LLaMA** model using **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** for aligned text generation.

## Features
- Actor-critic architecture with a reward model  
- Generates high-quality, human-aligned responses  

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place JSON data in dataset/ folder

Run training notebooks:

bash
复制代码
jupyter notebook 2.actor.ipynb
jupyter notebook 3.critic.ipynb
jupyter notebook 4.rlhf.ipynb
Test generation:

bash
复制代码
jupyter notebook 5.test.ipynb

Future Improvements
Support larger LLaMA models

Improve reward model and RLHF strategy

Optimize training efficiency and stability
